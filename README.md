# UAVs USING FOR DISASTER MANAGEMENT

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, to perform human count in images or videos. OpenCV provides various tools and algorithms for image processing, including object detection, which can be utilized for counting humans.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- **OpenCV**: The core library for image processing and computer vision tasks.
  - You can install OpenCV using pip (for Python) or by building from source.
- **Python**: This project is implemented in Python, so you need to have Python installed (version 3.5 or later recommended).
- **Human Detection Model**: You'll need a pre-trained model capable of detecting humans. Popular choices include Haar cascades, HOG + Linear SVM, or deep learning-based models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector). Ensure the model is accessible and configured properly within the code.

## Installation

1. Install OpenCV using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

2. Obtain a human detection model. You can either download a pre-trained model or train your own depending on your requirements.

3. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

4. Configure the human detection model path within the code.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python human_count.py
    ```

3. Provide the path to the image or video file you want to analyze.

4. The script will utilize the human detection model to detect humans in the given image or video and provide the count.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure your environment meets the hardware requirements for running OpenCV efficiently, especially if working with large images or videos.
- Experiment with different human detection models to find the one that best suits your needs in terms of accuracy and performance.
- Consider optimizing the code for real-time applications if necessary, as the processing time may vary depending on the complexity of the model and the input data.
